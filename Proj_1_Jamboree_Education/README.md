# About The Case Study

## Linear Regression Machine Learning Case study
### Problem statement:
* Jamboree is a renowned educational institution that has successfully assisted numerous
students in gaining admission to top colleges abroad. With their proven
problem-solving methods, they have helped students achieve exceptional scores on
exams like GMAT, GRE, and SAT with minimal effort.
* To further support students, Jamboree has recently introduced a new feature on their
website. This feature enables students to assess their probability of admission to Ivy
League colleges, considering the unique perspective of Indian applicants.
* By conducting a thorough analysis, we can assist Jamboree in understanding the crucial
factors impacting graduate admissions and their interrelationships. Additionally, we can
provide predictive insights to determine an individual's admission chances based on
various variables.


### Column Profiling:
* Serial No.: This column represents the unique row identifier for each applicant in the
dataset.
* GRE Scores: This column contains the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores of
the applicants, which are measured on a scale of 0 to 340.
* TOEFL Scores: This column includes the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)
scores of the applicants, which are measured on a scale of 0 to 120.
* University Rating: This column indicates the rating or reputation of the university that
the applicants are associated with.
  * The rating is based on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 representing the highest rating.
* SOP: This column represents the strength of the applicant's statement of purpose,
rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating a strong and compelling SOP.
* LOR: This column represents the strength of the applicant's letter of recommendation,
rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating a strong and compelling LOR.
* CGPA: This column contains the undergraduate Grade Point Average (GPA) of the
applicants, which is measured on a scale of 0 to 10.
* Research: This column indicates whether the applicant has research experience (1) or
not (0).
* Chance of Admit: This column represents the estimated probability or chance of
admission for each applicant, ranging from 0 to 1.


#### Analysis on the Data set has been executed on the Jupyter notebook.



## Work Flow on Data Set

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 1. Defining the problem statement.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 2. Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 3. Use Non-graphical and graphical analysis for getting insights about variables.
  
______________________________________________________________________________
##### 4. Perform data preprocessing.


______________________________________________________________________________
##### 5. Check the correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each
other.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 6. Prepare the data for modeling.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 7. Build the Linear Regression model.

______________________________________________________________________________
##### 8. Test the assumptions of linear regression.
* Multicollinearity check by VIF score
* Mean of residuals should be close to zero.
* Linear relationship between independent & dependent variables.
* Test for Homoscedasticity
* Normality of residuals
  
______________________________________________________________________________
##### 9. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
